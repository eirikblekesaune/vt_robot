#Verdensteatret Lokomotiv

##Circuit design
- MCU: PIC 16F876A
- Motor driver (Pololu VNH5019)
-          

##Current status
- Physical design must be smaller
- Attaching the motor driver must be done with screws, not tape, due to heat generated in motor driver.
- Need to add decoupling caps to voltage regultator
- Should put more sturdy connectors to motor and power connectors (Motor driver unit)
- Make PCB out of the circuit
- Add LED dimmer as external unit.
- Use the 9-bit addressing option and global broadcast of messages is possible in case the wireless transmission becomes to slow.
- Is it possible for you to add and SPI interface for connecting external units, such as LED dimmers, extra motors etc.
